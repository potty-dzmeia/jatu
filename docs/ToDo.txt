- [LogWindow2] to be able to show only certain qsos (e.g. callsign filter) and edit them fast. For example like n1mm in a sub-table below the main log.
- Option for continious CQ
- Option to remove manual spots
- format frequency so that it is shown as 3.534.2
- pressing CQ should change frequency automatically
- Change spotting to be F10
- when correcting callsign the call is written with small letters
- add validation, so that we can manually enter wrong data in the Log table(e.g. Snt 00300f)
- something is not working well when double pressing in the bandmap. Sometimes the the wrong freq is set.
- Add cabrilo export
- Add loading of different dbs files
- If Enter is pressed in callsign filed depending on the mode we should send hisCallsign+Snt or myCallsign
- send leading zeros as 'T'

After contest:
- band map should be updated depending on the current freq and mode
- there should be an option for entering worked frequency for people that do not use CAT
- when freq is written in the callsign window - transciever should change frequency.
