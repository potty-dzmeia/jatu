- K3 morse is not interruptable. 
  KY @                     ; worked but was having some nasty side effects.
  
  Now I will try KY @; togather with shorter KY text; command (without fixed 24 byte length)

- Option for continious CQ


- mark CQ frequency on bandmap
- pgup and pgdown to increase/decrease speed of the cw speed
- [LogWindow2] to be able to show only certain qsos (e.g. callsign filter) and edit them fast. For example like n1mm in a sub-table below the main log.
- Option to remove manual spots
- Add cabrilo export
- Add loading of different dbs files
- enter send message to call CQ when callsign textfield is empty


After contest:
- band map should be updated depending on the current freq and mode
- there should be an option for entering worked frequency for people that do not use CAT
- when freq is written in the callsign window - transciever should change frequency.
- For some reason F10 is activating the Menu
- add validation, so that we can't manually enter wrong data in the Log table(e.g. Snt 00300f)
- when correcting callsign in the log the call is written with small letters
- something is not working well when double pressing in the bandmap. Sometimes the the wrong freq is set.
- adjust row sizes depending on the font
