/**
 * A rig is an equipment which can be controlled with the help of commands 
 * send from the program to the rig. 
 * 
 * In the diagram below can be seen how we can communicate with the rig.
 * Example1: The person has rotated the knob on the radio and changed the frequency
 *    - The rig sends some data to the program
 *    - The Java program receives the data
 *    - The Java program gives the data to icom.py to be decoded 
 *    - The icom.py returns the parsed data (e.g. Frequency change to 14,000,000)
 *    - Java program can use this info for example to update the GUI with the new frequency
 * 
 * Example2: the person using the Java program wants to change the frequency on the radio to 14,200,000 
 *    - The Java program ask the icom.py to encode the frequency change command
 *    - Icom.py encodes the command into a transaction that the radio can understand and returns the data to the Java program
 *    - The Java program sends the transaction to the radio
 *    - The radio receives the transaction and changes the frequency to the desired value of 14,200,000
 *
